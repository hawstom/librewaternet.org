/**
 * build-features.php -- put the suite's feature list onto features.html.
 *
 * THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS IN THE OTHER REPOSITORY. `dev/features.md` in EngCalcs is itself
 * generated, from `dev/features-source.md`, by `dev/scripts/generate_features.php`. Nothing here
 * writes a feature sentence; this script only transforms them into the markup this page uses, so
 * the list cannot drift by somebody retyping it.
 *
 * Run it after the feature list changes over there:
 *
 *     php tools/build-features.php [path/to/engcalcs/dev/features.md]
 *
 * It rewrites only what sits between the sentinel comments in features.html. The page's design
 * and its framing prose are hand-written and are never touched.
 *
 * THREE DEPARTURES FROM THE SOURCE, all deliberate, all declared below rather than done quietly:
 *
 *  - SKIP_SECTIONS. A whole `## area` this site does not show. See that array's own note.
 *  - SKIP_IDS. One sentence kept off this page, with the reason.
 *  - OVERRIDE. A sentence replaced because it would be wrong on a public page. The map is EMPTY
 *    and should stay that way -- an override is a debt, not a mechanism, because it makes this
 *    page and the source disagree about the same fact. The honest fix is upstream, in
 *    features-source.md. See the array's own note.
 *
 * The last two are keyed by the task IDs the source cites, so a reworded sentence still lands
 * correctly and a DELETED one stops the build instead of vanishing silently.

/**
 * Sentences kept OFF this page, with the reason. Key: the source's cited IDs.
 *
 * `486` is the phone sentence, and it used to be RELOCATED rather than dropped: dev/positioning.md
 * §3 keeps mobile out of "a list of reasons to choose us" and gave it one home, the honest-edges
 * note at the foot of this page. **Tom deleted that whole note on 2026-09-12**, so the one place
 * the claim was allowed to stand is gone and there is nowhere to relocate it TO. It is therefore
 * not on this page at all, which §3 permits -- the rule constrains where the claim may appear, it
 * does not require the claim. Restore the note and this goes back to being a relocation.

 * Sections of the source this page does NOT show. Key: the `## ` heading, value: the reason.

 * **THIS SITE DOES NOT ADVERTISE THE CALCULATOR SUITE** (Tom, 2026-09-11: *"I don't think that LW
 * and its features page should advertise EC at all. I think we need to remove it."*). The two
 * products were one program until the divorce of 2026-09-11 (EngCalcs Task 625); the network model
 * now has its own chrome, its own front door at /app/, and no suite navbar. A features page that
 * still listed Manning pipe flow, orifice drain time, micro-hydropower, canal seepage and rock
 * chute sizing was selling somebody else's software on LibreWaterNet's own page.
 *
 * **SKIPPED HERE RATHER THAN DELETED AT THE SOURCE**, because `dev/features.md` is the EngCalcs
 * suite's own feature list and those features are real and still shipped -- they simply are not
 * this site's. One source of truth, two audiences; the choice of what to show belongs to the site
 * making it. A feature genuinely shared by both belongs in a section this page keeps, and the
 * offline/install line was moved there at the source for exactly that reason.

 * quietly disagree about the same fact. The one entry this map ever held -- the colour bullet,
 * which understated the ramp catalogue and contradicted index.html -- was fixed upstream in
 * dev/features-source.md instead, and removed from here. Fix the next one there too; reach for
 * this array only when the source cannot be touched, and empty it again as soon as it can.
